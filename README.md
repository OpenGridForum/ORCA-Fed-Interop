Group Summary:

      Working collaboratively with the Open Research Cloud Alliance (ORCA), the Open Grid Forum (OGF) has established
      the ORCA Federation and Interoperability Working Group (ORCA-FI WG). ORCAâ€™s mission is to support managed but
      open access to data, applications and infrastructure resources needed to conduct research across a globally
      distributed community. The purpose of the ORCA-FI WG is to facilitate the further adoption by the research
      community of federation tooling based on the NIST Cloud Federation Reference Architecture (CFRA), SP 500-332,
      and federation-specific standards being developed by IEEE P2302 WG to complement existing federation-relevant
      standards.

Charter Focus / Purpose and Scope:
      
      The specific scope of the ORCA-FI WG is to:
            1) develop and socialize use cases across research groups in academia, industry and government;
            2) collect, curate and make discoverable federation and interoperability toolsets that are consistent
               with the NIST CFRA and supportive of IEEE standards; and
            3) inform the further refinement of the NIST CFRA and federation/interoperability standards being
               developed through the IEEE P2302 WG.     
      A key part of these use cases will be to identify the deployment and governance models that are most
      appropriate.  This collection of use cases will also be used to identify the implementation approach(es)
      that will be practical and appealing to the widest segment of stakeholders.

Exit Strategy:

      The work of this group will be deemed complete with the finalization of the documents.

Goals/Deliverables:
